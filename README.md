Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### To Do

Had I more time I'd have:
* Broken up the sass files more to be tightly coupled  to the component.
* Removed the svgs as background images and created an SVG symbol library, which is more performant.
* Add the expand/collapse functionality to the side filter.
* Add a truncation filter to secondary filter items to match design.
* Add in accessibility attributes
