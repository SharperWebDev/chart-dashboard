This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

In the project directory run:

### 'npm install'

Installs dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### To Do

Had I had more time I'd have:
* Broken up the sass files more to be tightly coupled  to the component.
* Removed the svgs as background images and created an SVG symbol library, which is more performant.
* Add the expand/collapse functionality to the side filter.
* Add a truncation filter to secondary filter items to match design.
